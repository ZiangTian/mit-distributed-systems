### Lab3-B

For 3B I restructured and rewrote the entire code 3 times and did numerous tests. Finally passed it after 12 days of on-and-off debugging and expansive researching. I resorted to the `dslogs` in [this post](https://blog.josejg.com/debugging-pretty/) and it's been so helpful. This is how the debug log looks like on my terminal:

Other than this I also turned to Goland instead of VSCode for better debugging and clearer display. (VSCode still reigns regardless)
